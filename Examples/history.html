        miners on the Jos Plateau in the 1930s. Initially

        (New Stone Age), the Nok culture made the transition to the
        <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Iron-Age" target="_blank"
          >Iron-Age</a
        >. Its people raised crops and cattle and seem to have paid particular
        attention to personal adornment, especially of the hair. Distinctive
        features of Nok art include naturalism, stylized treatment of the mouth
        and eyes, relative proportions of the human head, body, and feet,
        distortions of the human facial features, and treatment of animal forms.
        The spread of Nok-type figures in a wide area south of the

          >Benue-River</a

        identifiable in the lives of the peoples of the area today. Many of the
        distinctive features of Nok art can also be traced in later developments
        of Nigerian art produced in such places as Igbo Ukwu,
        <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Ile-Ife" target="_blank"

        <p>
          Bronzes, which have been dated to about the 9th century ce, were
          discovered in the 1930s and ’40s at Igbo Ukwu, near the southwestern

            >African-art</a
          >.) They reveal not only a high artistic tradition but also a
          well-structured society with wide-ranging economic relationships. Of
          particular interest is the source of the copper and lead used to make
          the bronzes, which may have been Tadmekka in the Sahara, and of the
          coloured glass beads, some of which may have come from Venice and
          <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/India" target="_blank"

          the burial chamber of a high personage, possibly a forerunner of the
          eze nri, a priest-king, who held religious but not political power
          over large parts of the

          first noted the kingdom of

            >Lake-Chad</a
          >
          . The lake was then much larger than the present-day body of water,
          and its
          <a href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/basin" target="_blank"
            >basin</a
          >
          attracted settlements and encouraged exchange. A pastoral group,
          ancestors of the
          <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Kanuri" target="_blank"
            >Kanuri</a
          >, established a centralized state over those referred to collectively
          as the Sao. Initially, trading links extended to the Nile valley of
          <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Egypt" target="_blank"
            >Egypt</a
          >. There is some evidence that Kanem had made contact with the
          Christian kingdoms of
          <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Nubia" target="_blank"
            >Nubia</a
          >
          before it was overrun by Muslims, who gained a foothold in the ruling
          family of Kanem in the 11th century. From Kanem the rulers tried to
          dominate the areas south and west of the lake as well. By the 12th
          century they had been compelled by attacks from the Sao to move their
          capital to the region west of Lake Chad, and they gradually lost
          control of most of the original Kanem.

        <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Islam" target="_blank"
          >Islam</a

        mother and other female officials exercising considerable power. The
        selection of the monarch, the coronation rites, and other bases of royal
        authority were dictated by pre-Islamic beliefs. The princes and other
        members of the royal family were granted fiefs and posted away from the
        capital to govern frontier zones, while people of slave origin were
        preferred for the royal guard and palace officials.

            >Benin</a

          number of centralized states—such as
          <a

          city, a market centre, and a monarchical system of government. Islam,

          empire in the 14th century, strengthened both the monarchical system
          and the commercial contacts, but it remained predominantly an urban
          religion until the beginning of the 19th century. Even within the
          walled cities, however, some pre-Islamic
          <a href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/rites" target="_blank"
            >rites</a
          >
          remained part of the ceremonies that sustained monarchical authority.
          A considerable rivalry existed between the different states over
          agricultural land and the control of trade and trade routes, and
          Hausaland was periodically conquered by powerful neighbours such as
          Borno and Songhai.

          city-states and nucleated villages; a pantheon of gods, a few of which
          were recognized widely but with several local variations; and

          best known for its potsherd pavements and for the great artistry of
          its terra-cottas and bronzes, especially the naturalism of many of its

          all the monarchies of Yoruba states claim descent from Ife as a way of
          establishing legitimacy, sometimes borrowing regalia from Ife to use
          in coronation rites and sometimes sending remains of deceased rulers

        appear to have been the noncentralized peoples of the middle belt. The
        trade also caused severe economic and political dislocations,

        this way, all the Hausa states, parts of Borno, Nupe, Ilorin, and Fulani
        outposts in Bauchi and Adamawa were drawn into a single
        politico-religious system. The rulers of Borno invited Shehu (Sheikh)

        view that jihad was an acceptable tool against backsliding Muslims, to
        lead their defense of Borno against the Fulani jihad. In the process
        Islam was revived in Borno, and the old Seyfawa

        <h1>The collapse of Oyo</h1>
        <p>
          Although the Fulani intrusion into Ilorin largely contributed to the
          collapse of the Oyo empire, it was not the only cause. Deep-seated
          conflicts arose between the alafin, or ruler, and his chiefs,
          including both provincial rulers and lineage chiefs and councillors at
          the capital. In spite of the external threat from the Fulani and
          others, the conflicts could not be resolved. Fulani ascendancy at
          Ilorin cut off the supply of horses to
          <a
            href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Oyo-state-Nigeria"
            target="_blank"
            >Oyo</a
          >
          and made the defense of the capital
          <a
            href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/untenable"
            target="_blank"
            >untenable</a
          >. Large groups of people from Oyo had to migrate southward, where
          they established a new capital (at present-day Oyo) and other centres
          such as
          <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Ibadan" target="_blank"
            >Ibadan</a
          >
          and Ijaye. This pressure, in turn, pushed the Egba farther south,
          where they founded the town of
          <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Abeokuta" target="_blank"
            >Abeokuta</a
          >
          about 1830. The collapse of the Oyo empire unleashed a major
          redistribution of the Yoruba people and precipitated a series of
          Yoruba wars that lasted until 1886.

            target="_blank"

          an internal slave trade, because slaves were largely responsible for
          collecting palm fruits, manufacturing palm oil, and transporting it to
          the coast, whether by canoe or by

          porterage. The palm oil trade was also linked to the Sokoto jihad and
          the Yoruba wars, because many warriors recognized the importance of
          slaves not only as soldiers and producers of food to feed soldiers but
          additionally as producers of palm oil to trade for European dane guns
          and other goods.

        the sultan’s capital, Sokoto, fell the next month. All the territories

        first as Northern and Southern Nigeria and then with eventual
        amalgamation.

        The British penetration of Nigeria met with various forms of resistance

          >country</a

        wars against the Ijebu (a Yoruba group) in 1892, the Aro of eastern
        Igboland, and, until 1914, the Aniocha of western Igboland. In the north
        many emirates did not take military action, but the

          >deposed</a

        caliph, Atahiru I, rebelled in 1903. Many Muslims resorted to migration
        as a form of resistance, a tactic known as the hejira, in which those
        perceived as infidels are avoided.
        <h2></h2>
        Resistance was strong in western Igboland, where a series of wars were
        waged against the British. The Ekumeku, who were well organized and
        whose leaders were joined in secrecy oaths, effectively utilized
        guerrilla tactics to attack the British. Their forces, which were drawn
        from hundreds of
        <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Igbo" target="_blank">Igbo</a>

        Following Lugard’s success in the north, he set out the principles of
        the administrative system subsequently institutionalized as

          "indirect-rule"</a
        >.” Essentially, local government was to be left in the hands of the
        traditional chiefs, subject to the guidance of European officers. Native
        institutions were utilized and interference with local customs kept to a
        minimum, although the British did not always understand the local
        customs. While this system had built-in contradictions, over the years
        the Nigerian system developed into a sophisticated form of local
        government, especially in the emirates and under the banner of “native
        administration,” which became the

        Many changes accompanied British rule: Western education, the

          >Christianity</a

        spread during the period; new forms of money, transportation, and
        communication were developed; and the Nigerian economy became based on
        the export of cash crops. Areas with lucrative crops such as cacao and
        peanuts (groundnuts) profited, while many people in different parts of
        the
        <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/nation-state" target="_blank"
          >country</a
        >
        had to migrate to work elsewhere as tenant farmers or use their newly
        acquired education and skills to work in cities as wage earners,
        traders, and artisans. Two tiers of government emerged, central and
        local. The central government, presided over by the governor-general and
        accountable to the secretary for the colonies in London, was more
        powerful but distant from the people. Local administration, where the
        colonial citizens typically experienced colonial authority, was based on
        the policy of indirect rule first developed in the north.
        <h2></h2>
        To prevent any united opposition to its authority, the British adopted a
        divide-and-rule policy, keeping Nigerian groups separate from one
        another as much as possible. Traditional authorities were co-opted in
        the north, where the spread of Western education by Christian
        missionaries was strongly resisted by Muslim leaders. In the south the
        British occasionally created a political
        <a

        >, whether these people had held traditional positions of authority or
        not. Because Western education and Christianity spread rapidly in the
        south and not in the north, development was much slower in the north,
        and the growing disparity between north and south later caused political
        tensions.

        Although colonial rule appeared secure in the first two decades of the
        20th century, the British struggled to keep control of their Nigerian
        colony and continued to do so until Nigeria became independent in 1960.
        The British, when faced with dissent, tended to grant political reforms
        in an effort to dispel the attractiveness of more-radical suggestions.
        Early on in colonial rule, for example, Nigerians protested the manner
        in which water rates and head taxes were collected. Nigerians also
        requested more political representation. The Nigerian Legislative
        Council was established in 1914 and was given limited jurisdiction; it
        was replaced in 1922 by a larger one that included elected members from
        Lagos and
        <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Calabar" target="_blank"
          >Calabar</a
        >, although its powers also were limited and the northern provinces
        remained outside its control. A more representative system did not
        appear until 1946, when each geographic group of provinces had its own
        House of Assembly, with a majority of nonofficial (though not yet all
        elected) members; there were also a House of Chiefs and, in Lagos, a
        central Legislative Council. By 1919 the National Council of

        Beginning in the 1920s, a number of Nigerians joined other Blacks in

        After the 1930s, political activities focused primarily on ways to end
        British rule. A national party, the Nigerian Youth Movement, emerged in
        1934, and its members won elections to the Legislative Council. After

        The British answered this activity by attempting to create a more

        catch up with the educationally advanced south. Among the problems

        The NPN’s party leaders used political power as an opportunity to gain

        president in August–September 1983, although his landslide victory was
        attributed to gross voting irregularities. Shagari was not able to
        manage the political crisis that followed or to end Nigeria’s continuing

        Babangida at first presented to the public and the media the image of an
        affectionate and considerate leader. He released political detainees and
        promised that

        worked to undermine the process in order to retain power.
        <h2></h2>
        A transition program was announced in 1986 that was to terminate in 1990
        (later extended to 1993), and the military controlled the process. The
        government created two political parties, the

        (SDP) and the National Republican Convention (NRC), and produced their
        agendas for them; freely formed parties were not registered, and many
        politicians were banned from politics. The 1979 constitution was
        modified by a
        <a

        Assembly, and a series of elections were then held for local government
        councillors, state governors, and legislatures.
        <h2></h2>
        Although Babangida voided presidential primary elections held in 1992,
        and all the candidates were banned from politics, a presidential
        election was slated for June 1993 between two pro-government candidates:
        Chief

          >M.K.O Abiola</a
        >
        of the SDP and Alhaji Bashir Tofa of the NRC. The Babangida government
        believed that the elections would never take place and felt that, even
        if they did, the north-south divide would lead to a stalemate, as Abiola
        came from the south and Tofa from the north. Contrary to government
        expectation, however, the election was held on schedule, and it was
        free, fair, and peaceful. Chief Abiola won, but Babangida annulled the
        results before they became official. This turned out to be a serious
        miscalculation that forced him out of power in August 1993, and an

        reinstating military rule. Like Babangida, he promised a transition to
        civilian rule while pursuing the means to maintain power, but, unlike
        Babangida, he used excessive force to attain his ambition.

        If the political future of Nigeria appeared bright with the victory of
        Chief Abiola in June 1993, Abacha’s seizure of power and subsequent rule
        reversed most of the gains that the

          >country</a

        they advocated a confederacy with a weakened centre and even a divided
        army and police force. Opposition forces called for a national
        conference to renegotiate the basis of Nigerian unity. The country’s
        international image was damaged, as it suffered serious condemnation and
        isolation.

        critics; when Abiola proclaimed himself president, he was arrested in
        June 1994 and died in jail in 1998. Trade union movements were suspended
        and protesters were killed, yet opposition to the government,
        particularly outside of the country, did not abate. Abacha and his
        loyalists again used the state as an instrument of personal gain.

        The decisive turning point in military disengagement came with Abacha’s

        freed political prisoners, ended the harassment of political opponents,

        remained sluggish.

        <h2>The 1999 elections</h2>
        <p>
          After Abacha’s death, political activity blossomed as numerous parties
          were formed. Of these, three emerged that were able to contest

          >, and the All People’s Party. A series of elections were held in
          January–March 1999 in which councillors for local governments,
          legislatures for state and federal assemblies, and state governors
          were selected. The presidential election took place in February and
          was carefully monitored by an international team of observers.

          achieved independence in 1960, Obasanjo was reelected in 2003,
          although there were widespread reports of voting irregularities.

        <h2>Domestic unrest and insecurity</h2>
        <p>
          Although conditions in Nigeria were generally improved under Obasanjo,
          there was still considerable strife within the country. Ethnic
          conflict—previously kept in check during the periods of military
          rule—now erupted in various parts of Nigeria, and friction increased
          between Muslims and Christians when some of the northern and central
          states chose to adopt Islamic law (the
          <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/sharia" target="_blank"
            >sharia</a

          ). Demonstrations were held to protest the government’s oil policies
          and high fuel prices. Residents of the

          also protested the operations of petroleum companies in their area,

            target="_blank"
            >asserting</a
          >
          that the companies exploited their land while not providing a
          reasonable share of the petroleum profits in return. Their protests
          evolved into coordinated militant action in 2006. Petroleum companies
          were targeted: their employees were kidnapped, and refineries and
          pipelines were damaged as militants attempted to disrupt oil
          production and inflict economic loss. The Movement for the
          Emancipation of the Niger

          activity decreased after the group declared a unilateral ceasefire,
          and the government introduced an amnesty program in 2009.

        <h2>Bakassi Peninsula dispute</h2>
        <p>
          Obasanjo was also faced with resolving an ongoing border dispute with

          the area in the subsequent years. He also received much domestic

          questioned the fate of the large number of Nigerians living in the
          region and cited the long-standing cultural ties between the Bakassi
          Peninsula and Nigeria. Nevertheless, Obasanjo eventually honoured the
          terms of the ruling in 2006 when Nigeria relinquished its claim to the
          peninsula and withdrew its forces.
        </p>
        <h2></h2>
        The process of transferring the peninsula to Cameroon was not without
        its problems, including the ongoing issue of resettling Nigerians
        displaced by the transfer and the dissatisfaction of those who remained
        but were now under Cameroonian rule. In November 2007 Nigeria’s Senate
        voted to void the agreement that had ceded the Bakassi Peninsula to
        <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Cameroon" target="_blank"
          >Cameroon</a
        >. However, this action did not affect the actual status of the
        peninsula, and a ceremony held on August 14, 2008, marked the completion
        of the peninsula’s transfer from Nigeria to Cameroon.

        Yar’Adua never fully recovered, however, and he died on May 5, 2010;

          by Jonathan was the reformation of the electoral process. Noting the
          irregularities associated with the 2007 presidential election, he
          vowed to make fair and transparent elections a priority, beginning
          with those scheduled for 2011. Voting in Nigeria’s legislative
          elections began on April 2, 2011, but, because necessary electoral
          materials were not available in some areas, voting was halted and
          postponed until April 9 (April 26 in some locations). As a result, the
          presidential election that was scheduled for April 9 was delayed until
          April 16. Jonathan was the overwhelming winner of the presidential
          election, receiving almost 59 percent of the vote among a field of 19
          other challengers. Former military leader and head of state

          placed second, with about 32 percent of the vote. In other elections,
          the PDP did not fare as well as in previous years, but it managed to
          maintain control of the legislature and a majority of state
          governorship posts. International observers praised the elections as
          being largely free and fair. The polls were not completely without
          violence or controversy, however, as supporters of Buhari and other
          losing candidates rioted, primarily in the north, and accused the

          Among the most-pressing concerns in Jonathan’s first full term as
          president was the ongoing threat presented by
          <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Boko-Haram" target="_blank"
            >Boko-Haram</a
          >, an Islamic sectarian movement founded in 2002 in northeastern
          Nigeria; the group claimed to want to end the corruption and injustice
          in the country and impose Sharīʿah, or
          <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/sharia" target="_blank"
            >Islamic Law</a
          >. Boko Haram did not gain widespread notoriety until 2009 when, after
          an altercation with military and local police forces, it began
          attacking police and government targets, killing and injuring many; in
          response, security forces launched a crackdown on the group, killing
          many members. Shortly thereafter, the group’s leader,

          following years.

        <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/93/168093-050-529284A0/Nigeria-Areas-Boko-Haram.jpg" alt="Boko haram attacks in Nigeria">
        Boko Haram’s attacks grew in intensity and frequency, occurring
        primarily in northeastern and central Nigeria and typically targeting
        government buildings, military barracks, the police, and Christian
        churches and schools. Extrajudicial violence and killings by the police
        and military while in the pursuit of the group’s members were not
        uncommon and further heightened tensions in the country; the
        extrajudicial activity was also widely condemned by
        <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/human-rights" target="_blank"
          >human-rights</a
        >
        groups. In 2012 some estimates held that more than 2,800 people had been
        killed by Boko Haram or by the security forces pursuing the group. The
        idea of granting amnesty to the group members if they disarmed—similar
        to what had been done with the MEND rebels in 2009—had been periodically
        proposed but dismissed for various reasons. In April 2013, however, with
        Boko Haram’s violence showing little sign of abatement and the previous
        strategies of dealing with the group by force clearly proven
        ineffective, Jonathan appointed a committee to investigate the
        implementation of an amnesty program, but it bore little fruit. In June
        Jonathan officially declared Boko Haram a terrorist group and banned it
        under Nigerian law. The militants and anyone caught helping them could
        then be prosecuted under the country’s Terrorism Prevention Act, which
        was expected to

        <h2></h2>
        Boko Haram’s attacks continued throughout the rest of 2013 and into
        2014, with the government unable to do much to stop the group. In April
        2014 Boko Haram’s mass kidnapping of more than 275 girls from a

        in Chibok in Borno state brought the group and its unabated campaign of
        terror into the international spotlight. The kidnapping was widely
        condemned across the globe and generated an increase in offers of
        international assistance to Nigeria, which, unlike in the past, the
        country was now more willing to accept. Neighbouring countries as well
        as Western nations worked with Nigeria to

          target="_blank"
          >UN security Council</a
        >
        imposed sanctions on individuals in Boko Haram—freezing assets and
        issuing travel bans and an arms embargo—but, given the nature of the
        group’s operations, it was unclear if the sanctions would actually have
        an impact on Boko Haram’s activities. They did not: the group’s attacks
        continued, and in August Boko Haram declared the areas under its control
        to be an Islamic state.

        <h1>The 2015 elections and electorate concerns</h1>
        <p>
          The government’s inability to eliminate the threat from Boko Haram was
          one of the key issues in the run-up to the 2015 presidential and
          legislative elections, along with the economy and the

          complaint of corruption. Economic progress was mixed: Nigeria’s
          economy grew to be the continent’s largest in 2014, but the
          oil-reliant economy also experienced sharp decline later that year
          because of plunging oil prices on the world market. Also, despite
          overall

          >
          during Jonathan’s term, many Nigerians, especially those in rural
          areas and in the north, lived in poverty. The elections had originally
          been scheduled for mid-February, but the country’s electoral
          commission postponed them for six weeks, citing the current level of
          violence from Boko Haram in the northeast as an impediment to holding
          elections there. Jonathan, who had been criticized along with the
          military for not doing enough to combat Boko Haram, accepted
          assistance from the neighbouring countries of

          troops from Nigeria and the aforementioned countries, and an offensive
          was launched against the militants. Marked progress was made in the

          Buhari faced several challenges as president. In 2016, declining oil
          revenue led to Nigeria’s first recession in more than 25 years.
          Although some recovery progress was evident by 2018, many Nigerian

          earned the unenviable distinction that year of having the most people
          in extreme poverty in the world. Many questioned whether Buhari was
          fit enough to serve as president, as he repeatedly left the country
          for medical treatment of an undisclosed ailment; in 2017 he was absent
          for several months. There was progress in the fight against

        Province (ISWAP; later more commonly known as Islamic State in West
        Africa, or ISWA). The next year the group experienced a schism, with one
        faction retaining that name and the other reverting back to the original
        appellation. Although the military had made progress against Boko Haram
        and ISWA by late 2016, attacks later resumed, crushing hopes that the

        and farmers in central Nigeria and unrest in the southeast stemming from
        the long-running issue of militants disrupting oil production as well as
        the resurgence of the Biafran secessionist movement. The latter group in

          of logistical problems, it was postponed just hours before it was due
          to begin and was held a week later, on February 23. Buhari was
          reelected, taking 56 percent of the vote; Abubakar, his nearest
          challenger, won 41 percent. He was inaugurated for his second term on

          Peter Obi of the Labour Party were the front-runners. During the
          run-up to the election, the candidates’ campaigns largely focused on
          the main concerns of Nigerians: the increasing insecurity in the

        he 2023 elections were notable for being the first in which Nigeria’s
