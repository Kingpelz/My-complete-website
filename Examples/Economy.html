    <h1>Economy of Nigeria</h1>
    <p>
      The Nigerian economy is one of the largest in Africa. Since the late 1960s
      it has been based primarily on the petroleum industry. A series of world
      oil price increases from 1973 produced rapid
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/economic-growth" target="_blank"
        >economic-growth</a
      >
      in transportation, construction, manufacturing, and government services.
      Because this led to a great influx of rural people into the larger urban
      centres, agricultural production stagnated to such an extent that cash
      crops such as palm oil, peanuts (groundnuts), and cotton were no longer
      significant export commodities. In addition, from about 1975 Nigeria was
      forced to import such basic commodities as
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/plant/rice" target="_blank">rice</a>
      and
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/plant/cassava" target="_blank"
        >cassava</a

      for domestic

        href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consumption"
        target="_blank"
        >consumption</a
      >. This system worked well as long as revenues from petroleum remained
      constant, but since the late 1970s the agricultural sector has been in
      continuing crisis because of the fluctuating world oil market and the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/nation-state" target="_blank"

      >
      rapid

        href="https://www.britannica.com/science/population-growth"
        target="_blank"
        >population-growth</a
      >. Although much of the population remained engaged in farming, too little
      food was produced, requiring increasingly costly imports. The various
      governments (most of them military-run) have dealt with this problem by
      banning agricultural imports and by focusing,
      <a
        href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/albeit"
        target="_blank"
        >albeit</a
      >
      briefly, on various agricultural and indigenization plans.
    </p>

    <h2></h2>
    In the late 1990s the government began to privatize many state-run
    enterprises—especially in communications, power, and transportation—in order
    to
    <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enhance" target="_blank"
      >enhance</a
    >
    the quality of service and reduce dependence on the government. Most of the
    enterprises had been successfully privatized by the beginning of the 21st
    century, but a few remained in government hands.
    <h2></h2>
    At the turn of the 21st century, Nigeria continued to face an unsteady
    revenue flow, which the government attempted to counter by borrowing from
    international sources, introducing various
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/austerity" target="_blank"
      >austerity</a
    >
    measures, or doing both at the same time. As a result, an ever-increasing
    share of the national budget was needed for debt repayment, which, with
    corruption dominating government operations, meant that very little of
    Nigeria’s income was being spent on the people and their needs. The country
    benefited from a 2005 debt-relief plan by which the majority of its debt to
    a group of creditor countries known as the Paris Club would be forgiven once
    it had repaid a certain amount. Nigeria successfully met this condition in
    2006, becoming the first African country to settle its debt with the group.
    Nigeria entered a recession in 2016, partly because of falling global oil
    prices, but saw progress with recovery within the next couple of years. (For

    Nigeria has no shortage of arable land overall, but there is an extreme
    shortage of farmland in the most densely settled areas of the southeastern
    states and around

    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ibibio" target="_blank">Ibibio</a
    >, and
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hausa" target="_blank">Hausa</a>
    people to migrate to other parts of the country. Often, however, cultural
    traditions, such as the prohibition against selling family land, have
    restricted access to farmland in some localities that appear to have
    abundant cultivable land, and, in the far north,
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/desertification" target="_blank"
      >desertification</a
    >
    has severely limited the land area available for cultivation.
    <h2></h2>
    Roughly between one-fifth to one-half of all Nigerians obtain a living from
    agricultural production. Most are small-scale subsistence farmers who
    produce only a little surplus for sale and who derive additional income from
    one or more cash crops and from the sale of local crafts. Because the soil
    is not totally
    <a
      href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/amenable"
      target="_blank"
      >amenable</a
    >
    to mechanized equipment, the hoe and matchet (machete) continue to be the
    dominant farm
    <a
      href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/implements"
      target="_blank"
      >implements</a
    >. The shortage of farmland in some localities and limited access to land in
    others are among the factors that restrict the size of farmland
    <a
      href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cultivated"
      target="_blank"
      >cultivated</a
    >
    per family. Environmental deterioration, inferior storage facilities, a poor
    transport system, and a lack of investment capital contribute to low
    productivity and general stagnation in agriculture. With the population
    growing rapidly and urbanization accelerating, the food deficit continues to
    worsen despite government efforts to rectify the situation.
    <h2></h2>
    Root crops—notably yams, taro, and cassava—are the main food crops in the
    south, while grains and legumes—such as
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/plant/sorghum-grain" target="_blank"
      >sorghum-grain</a
    >,
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/plant/millet-plant" target="_blank"
      >millet-plant</a
    >, cowpeas, and
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/plant/corn-plant" target="_blank"
      >corn-plant</a
    >
    (maize)—are the staple crops of the drier north. Rice is also an important
    domestic crop. Trees—notably
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/plant/oil-palm" target="_blank"
      >oil-palm</a
    >, cacao, and rubber trees—are the principal industrial crops of the south,
    while peanuts (groundnuts) and cotton are produced in the north. Small-scale
    farmers dominate the production of industrial crops, as they do with staple
    food crops. Cocoa beans, from the cacao tree, are the major agricultural
    export; production of other industrial crops has declined, owing to the
    general stagnation in agriculture.
    <h2></h2>
    In 1982, in the first major step taken to halt the decline in industrial
    crop production, the government disbanded the produce marketing boards,
    which paid prices set by the government. Many farmers have since been
    motivated to
    <a
      href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cultivate"
      target="_blank"
      >cultivate</a
    >
    tree crops, and the federal and state governments have established
    plantations of oil palm, rubber, and cacao. Programs to
    <a
      href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alleviate"
      target="_blank"
      >alleviate</a
    >
    the food shortage have featured the direct purchase and distribution of
    foodstuffs by government agencies and the production by government
    parastatals of various staples on large commercial farms. The Operation Feed
    the Nation program of 1976–80 sought to increase local food production and
    thereby reduce imports. Citizens were encouraged to cultivate any empty plot
    of land, urban dwellers being encouraged to garden undeveloped building
    plots.
    <h2></h2>
    The raising of sheep, pigs, and goats was underdeveloped at the beginning of
    the 21st century. The cattle-herding
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Fulani" target="_blank">Fulani</a>
    are still the main beef producers, although some of the cattle under the
    care of these nomads belong to settled farmers and city dwellers. However,
    the level of meat consumption in Nigeria, as in most African countries, does
    not approach that of the West.
    <h2></h2>
    Nigeria’s permanent forest reserves occupy less than one-tenth of the total
    land area. Outside these reserves, much of the forest cover has been
    destroyed through regular burning to prepare land for farming or to
    <a
      href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/facilitate"
      target="_blank"
      >facilitate</a
    >
    hunting. Forest destruction is most extensive in the more densely settled
    areas, such as the Niger

      href="https://www.britannica.com/science/delta-river-system-component"
      target="_blank"
      >delta-river-system-component</a
    >, and in the drier savanna, where overgrazing, bush fires, and the great
    demand for fuelwood prevent normal regeneration of plants on fallow land.
    There are many large plantations of
    <a
      href="https://www.britannica.com/science/invasive-species"
      target="_blank"
      >invasive-species</a
    >, such as gmelina and teak, established by the government to provide
    electric and telegraph poles and fuelwood. In the arid zone of
    <a

      href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Kano-state-Nigeria"

      >Kano-state-Nigeria</a
    >, and
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Borno" target="_blank">Borno</a>
    states, forest belts have been established to help arrest the southward
    advance of the Sahara. Forest plantations have been established in many
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/watersheds" target="_blank"
      >watersheds</a
    >
    to protect water catchment areas of rivers and to reduce the incidence of
    soil erosion.
    <h2></h2>
    Fishing has assumed greater importance as a food source following the loss
    of thousands of head of livestock during the recurring drought in the
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Sahel" target="_blank">Sahel</a>
    since the early 1970s. The domestic catch supplies more than half of the
    fish demand.
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Lake-Chad" target="_blank"
      >Lake-Chad</a
    >
    and the southern coastal waters are the main sources of fish, but large
    quantities are caught every year in pools in seasonal rivers of the northern
    states.
    <h1>Resources and power</h1>
    <p> <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/91/37991-004-EF6DA56A/oil-drilling-platform-Gulf-of-Guinea-Port-Harcourt.jpg?w=300" alt="offshore oil rig">
      Nigeria has a variety of both renewable and nonrenewable resources, some
      of which have not yet been effectively tapped. Solar energy, probably the
      most extensive of the underutilized renewable resources, is likely to
      remain untapped for some time.
    </p>
    <h2></h2>
    Resource extraction is the most important sector of the economy. The most
    economically valuable minerals are
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/crude-oil" target="_blank"
      >crude-oil</a
    >,
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/natural-gas" target="_blank"
      >natural-gas</a
    >, coal,
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/tin" target="_blank">tin</a>,
    and columbite (an iron-bearing mineral that accompanies tin). Petroleum,
    first discovered in 1956, is the most important source of government
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/revenue" target="_blank"
      >revenue</a
    >
    and foreign exchange. Most of the oil output comes from onshore fields in
    the
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Niger" target="_blank">Niger</a>,
    although an increasing proportion of the crude is produced at offshore
    locations. There are oil refineries at
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Port-Harcourt" target="_blank"
      >Port-Harcourt</a
    >,
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Warri" target="_blank">Warri</a>,
    and
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Kaduna-Nigeria" target="_blank"
      >Kaduna-Nigeria</a
    >. Nigeria has been a member of
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/OPEC" target="_blank">OPEC</a>
    since 1971.
    <h2></h2>
    There are vast reserves of natural gas, but most of the gas produced is a
    by-product of crude oil. In the past this was burned off, as there was no
    market for it, but production has since increased, and Nigeria became a
    globally ranked exporter of this commodity. Production has often been
    interrupted by protests, as the inhabitants of the oil-producing regions
    have demanded a larger share of the
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/revenues" target="_blank"
      >revenues</a
    >.
    <h2></h2>
    Nigeria possesses significant reserves of coal, but these deposits are being
    developed gradually. Coal is used by the railroad, by traditional metal
    industries, and by power plants to generate electricity. Coal mining,
    initially concentrated around the city of
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Enugu-Nigeria" target="_blank"
      >Enugu-Nigeria</a
    >
    and its environs, began in 1915. It declined after the late 1950s with the
    discovery of oil but subsequently increased. Substantial coal reserves of
    varying quality can be found in south-central states in a band that
    stretches from
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Benin" target="_blank">Benin</a>
    to
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Cameroon" target="_blank"
      >Cameroon</a
    >. Deposits discovered more recently in the southwestern part of the country
    at Lafia-Obi are being developed for the Ajaokuta steel complex.
    <h2></h2>
    The
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Jos-Plateau" target="_blank"
      >Jos-Plateau</a
    >, where tin mining began in 1905, also contains columbite. By the early
    21st century, the country’s tin-smelting
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/capacity" target="_blank"
      >capacity</a
    >
    had not been reached, a result of diminished world demand in the late 1980s;
    production of columbite has also declined since the mid-1970s. There are
    iron ore deposits in the
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Lokoja" target="_blank">Lokoja</a>
    area, and
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/limestone" target="_blank"
      >limestone</a
    >
    occurs in many areas, where it is widely exploited for manufacturing cement
    and for use in the steel industry. Extensive iron ore deposits found in
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Kwara" target="_blank">Kwara</a>
    state have been exploited since 1984. Other mined minerals include gypsum,
    kaolin, barite, gold, sapphires, topazes, and aquamarines. There are also
    uranium deposits in the country.
    <h2></h2>
    About one-fifth of the country’s power is provided by hydroelectricity,
    although this source has the potential to provide an even greater amount of
    power. The main sources of

    state), and Jebba (Kwara state). Thermal plants fired with natural gas and
    coal supply about four-fifths of the country’s power and include those at
    Afam,
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Sapele" target="_blank">Sapele</a

    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Lagos-Nigeria" target="_blank"
      >Lagos-Nigeria</a
    >
    and on the Oji River. Demand, however, always exceeds supply. Fuelwood
    (firewood and charcoal) is still an important energy source for domestic
    use.
    <h1>Manufacturing</h1>
    <p>
      The federal government has established such capital-intensive industries
      as steel mills, pulp and paper mills, petrochemical plants, and an
      aluminum smelter. In the past, large-scale manufacturing—dominated by the
      production of textiles, tobacco, beverages, and cement—was controlled by
      foreign investors. The government’s indigenization efforts have altered
      the ownership situation, although the management and effective control of
      most large factories have remained in the hands of expatriate
      representatives of multinational corporations. The greatest weakness of
      this sector has been its dependence on imported raw materials. That
      situation changed in 1987, when the import of a wide range of raw
      materials was prohibited, although the ban was later
      <a
        href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rescinded"
        target="_blank"
        >rescinded</a
      >. Even so, imports were subject to some restrictions at the beginning of
      the 21st century, and manufacturers were encouraged to use raw materials
      from local sources. The highest concentration of large factories is in the
      Greater Lagos area. Each state capital has a number of large manufacturing
      industries, but a few major industries, such as paper mills and steel
      mills, are located in remote areas where new towns have grown up to serve
      the factories.
    </p>
    <h2></h2>
    Traditional industries carried out in homes or in makeshift workshops
    include the making of iron
    <a
      href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/implements"
      target="_blank"
      >implements</a
    >
    such as hoes and hatchets, door hinges, bolts, and dane guns (firearms of
    obsolete design, originally of European manufacture). Traditional soap- and
    salt-making workshops appeared in large numbers after the near collapse of
    the Nigerian economy in 1983, when most wage earners were unable to pay for
    factory-made soap and imported
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/salt" target="_blank"
      >table salt </a
    >. These industries continued after the economy recovered, but they were
    concentrated in rural areas. Pottery making and wood carving are widespread,
    as are canework and the making of bags and mats from raffia.
    <h1>Finance of Nigeria</h1>

      The Central Bank of Nigeria issues the national currency, the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/naira" target="_blank">naira</a

      branches in all the state capitals and provides guidelines to all
      commercial and

        >country</a

      shares to Nigerians. Banks proliferated in the 1980s, after the financial
      sector was liberalized. Many of these banks proved unstable, however, and
      in 1995 the government was forced to rescue some of them. Soon after, the
      government began privatizing banks and closing those that had violated
      banking regulations. By the beginning of the 21st century, the country had
      some 100 banks and financial institutions, and branch locations were
      widespread. There are a

      beans, onions, and livestock to the southern states. Yams from the central
      region are traded in the southern and far northern cities. Most of the
      food items and manufactured goods are sold in open market stalls, in small
      neighbourhood shops, and on the streets.

    a trade deficit, which resulted from the importation of large quantities of
    machinery and equipment. By the late 1960s it had a trade surplus, as
    revenue from crude oil exports allowed the country to import capital goods
    and industrial raw materials. Trade deficits returned in the mid-1970s.
    Since then Nigeria’s
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/balance-of-trade" target="_blank"
      >balance-of-trade</a
    >
    has alternated between periods of deficits and of surpluses, driven by
    fluctuations in the global oil market and government decisions on how to
    spend its money. A trade surplus in 1980, for example, allowed work to
    continue on the new federal capital-designate,
    <a
      href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Abuja-national-capital-Nigeria"
      target="_blank"
      >Abuja-national-capital-Nigeria</a
    >, but by 1982 the surplus had become a deficit, and at the end of 1983 the
    country was virtually bankrupt. At the beginning of the 21st century,
    exports were greater than imports, but the interest on the country’s
    external debt was so high that a truly favourable balance of trade (as
    opposed to one that existed on paper only) hinged at least partly on the
    effectiveness of debt relief.

      Nigeria has many attractions of interest to tourists. There are miles of
      coastal beaches, wildlife reserves, a variety of

      Nigeria has a long history of labour movements and contains numerous
      unions. Under the various military governments, labour activity was
      sharply curtailed. After the democratic elections in 1999, however, labour
      movements were once again able to express their discontent, and various
      strikes took place at the end of the 20th century and into the beginning
      of the 21st.

    In the southern part of Nigeria, women perform the majority of the
    agricultural labour, and, in cities such as Lagos, women dominate the market
    activity as well. No legal barriers

    women in northern states, especially those following Islamic law (
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/sharia" target="_blank">sharia</a>
    ), have their activities more tightly controlled.

    The main sources of government finance consist of petroleum royalties and
    rents, import duties, and corporate income and value-added taxes.
    <h1>Transportation and telecommunications</h1>
    <h2>Roads</h2>
    <p>
      Roads are the most important means of transportation in Nigeria, carrying
      more than four-fifths of all passenger and freight traffic. The general
      pattern of road transport, from north to south and from the interior to
      the southern seaports, dates to the colonial period, when raw materials
      were shipped to
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/United-Kingdom" target="_blank"
        >United-Kingdom</a
      >
      and other western European countries, which returned them as finished
      goods. More roads were added, particularly in the 1970s and early ’80s.
    </p>
    <h2></h2>
    Road traffic is heaviest in densely settled areas and where there is greater
    economic activity, such as in the cacao belt of southwestern Nigeria, the
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/plant/peanut" target="_blank">peanut</a>
    and cotton belt of the

    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/tin" target="_blank">tin</a>
    fields, and the palm belt of southeastern Nigeria. These areas are served by
    a
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/dense" target="_blank"
      >dense</a
    >
    network of all-weather roads. Areas that are more sparsely settled or not as
    economically productive tend to have a less-developed road network.
    <h2></h2>
    Because the well-developed road system of the 1970s and ’80s was not
    maintained, road conditions have deteriorated, leading to dangerous
    conditions and longer travel times. Road safety standards also are poor; the
    accident rate is high. The government created a Road Sector Development Team
    in 2009 to coordinate repairs and improvements to the country’s road
    network.

    Lagos and other large cities have
    <a
      href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/notorious"
      target="_blank"
      >notorious</a
    >
    traffic problems; streets are packed with both pedestrians and vehicles that
    create traffic tie-ups called “go slows.” To ease the traffic problems,
    people often share taxis or ride in trucks.
    <h1>Railroads</h1>
    <p>
      Now surpassed by roads, railroads were once the dominant transport system.
      The railroad system has two single-track trunk lines: the eastern line
      from
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Port-Harcourt" target="_blank"
        >port Port-Harcourt</a
      >
      to
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Maiduguri" target="_blank"
        >Maiduguri</a
      >
      and the western line from Lagos to
      <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Kano-historical-kingdom-Nigeria"
        target="_blank"
        >Kano-historical-kingdom-Nigeria</a
      >. Branch lines connect the western trunk line to
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Kaura-Namoda" target="_blank"
        >Kaura-Namoda</a
      >,
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Nguru" target="_blank">Nguru</a
      >, and

      on the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Niger" target="_blank">Niger</a
      >. Since 1960 tracks have been relaid with heavier rails to permit greater
      loads and higher speeds, signals have been improved to speed rail
      movements, and steam engines have been replaced by diesel locomotives.
      Beginning in the 1990s, there was expansion of the railway system,
      including the laying of new track between
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Warri" target="_blank">Warri</a>
      and Ajaokuta and the addition of
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/mass-transit" target="_blank"
        >mass-transit</a
      >
      lines between Lagos and several cities to the west. An ambitious 25-year
      plan unveiled in the 2000s saw continued efforts to improve and expand the
      railway system, including a new line from Abuja to
      <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Kaduna-state-Nigeria"
        target="_blank"
        >Kaduna-state-Nigeria</a

      that was inaugurated in 2016. A light rail system began operating in Abuja
      in 2018.

    <h1>Shipping and air transport</h1>

      Creeks and rivers were historically the primary avenue of
      <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/transportation"
        target="_blank"
        >transportation</a

      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Niger-River" target="_blank"
        >Niger-River</a
      >
      and
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Benue-River" target="_blank"
        >Benue-River</a
      >, were dredged in the 1990s because they were drying up; they still carry
      substantial quantities of goods. The

      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Calabar" target="_blank"
        >Calabar</a
      >, but, like other rivers in Nigeria, it is not navigable during the dry
      season. Passenger and cargo boats operate on the lagoons and on the many
      creeks along the Nigerian coast from Lagos to the Cross River. Delta Ports
      (in Warri), Calabar, and Port Harcourt, administered by the Nigerian Ports
      Authority, are the main international seaports. The Lagos port complex
      (including the Apapa port) and nearby Tin Can Island port complex are also
      important.
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Bonny" target="_blank">Bonny</a>

      are the major ports for shipment of petroleum.
    </p>
    <h2></h2>
    Almost all the state capitals are served by air transport. Lagos, Kano,
    Abuja, and Port Harcourt handle most of the international air traffic. At
    the beginning of the 21st century, Nigeria had a notoriously poor aviation
    safety record, but it has since improved.
    <h1>Telecommunications</h1>
    <p>
      Mobile phone service has expanded considerably more quickly than landline
      telephone service. Although telephone lines have existed in the major
      cities since the late 1970s, service was expensive and
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/inadequate" target="_blank"
        >inadequate</a
      >
      and was often cut off for no apparent reason; their use has declined. Use
      of cellular phones, on the other hand, has spread steadily since the late
      1990s. Internet service began to expand rapidly at the beginning of the
      21st century.
