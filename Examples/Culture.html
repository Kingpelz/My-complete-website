    <h1>Cultural life</h1>
    <h2>Cultural milieu</h2>
    
    <p>
      Nigeria’s rich and varied cultural heritage derives from the mixture of
      its ethnic groups with Arabic and western European influences. The country
      combines traditional
      <a
        href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/culture"
        target="_blank"
        >culture</a
      >
      with international urban sophistication. Secret societies, such as Ekpo
      and Ekpe among the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Igbo" target="_blank">Igbo</a>,
      were formerly used as instruments of government, while other institutions
      were associated with matrimony. According to the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Fulani" target="_blank"
        >Fulani</a
      >
      custom of sharo (test of young manhood), rival suitors underwent the
      ordeal of caning as a means of eliminating those who were less persistent.
      In
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ibibio" target="_blank"
        >Ibibio</a
      >
      territory, girls approaching marriageable age were confined for several
      years in bride-fattening rooms before they were given to their husbands. A
      girl was well-fed during this confinement, with the intent of making her
      plump and therefore more attractive to her future husband; she would also
      receive instruction from older women on how to be a good wife. These and
      other customs were discouraged by colonial administrators and
      missionaries. Some of the more adaptable cultural institutions have been
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/revived" target="_blank"
        >revived</a
      >
      since independence; these include Ekpo and Ekong societies for young boys
      in parts of the southeast and the Ogboni society found in the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Yoruba" target="_blank"
        >Yoruba</a
      >
      and
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Edo-people" target="_blank"

      areas of southern Nigeria. (For information on the historical role of

      of imported ones. Establishments serving alcoholic beverages are found
      everywhere except where Islamic laws prohibit them. Hotels and nightclubs
      are part of the landscape of the larger cities. Movie theatres, showing
      mostly Indian and American films, are popular among the urban middle- and
      low-income groups. Radio, television, and other forms of home
      entertainment (e.g., recorded music and movies) have also grown in
      popularity, though their use is dependent on the availability of
      electricity.

    Whether in urban or rural areas, the family is the central institution.
    Families gather to celebrate births and weddings. Funerals are also times
    when the family gathers. Because so many Nigerians live outside the
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/nation-state" target="_blank"
      >country</a
    >, funerals for non-Muslims are often delayed for a month or more to allow
    all the family members to make plans to return home.
    <h2></h2>
    Food is an important part of Nigerian life. Seafood, beef, poultry, and goat
    are the primary sources of protein. With so many different
    <a
      href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cultures"
      target="_blank"
      >cultures</a
    >
    and regions, food can vary greatly. In the southern areas a variety of soups
    containing a base of tomatoes, onions, red pepper, and palm oil are prepared
    with vegetables such as okra and meat or fish. Soups can be thickened by
    adding ground egusi (melon) seeds. Gari (ground cassava), iyan (yam paste),
    or plantains accompany the soup. Rice is eaten throughout the country, and
    in the north grains such as
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/plant/millet-plant" target="_blank"
      >millet</a
    >
    and wheat are a large part of the diet. Beans and root vegetables are
    <a

      target="_blank"
      >ubiquitous</a
    >. Many dishes are flavoured with onions, palm oil, and chilies.
    <h2></h2>
    Nigerians celebrate several holidays throughout the year, including
    Independence Day (October 1),
    <a

      Nigeria has a rich artistic heritage, including both traditional and
      contemporary art forms. From the naturalistic statues produced at

      pre-colonial Nigeria. While many artists still work in these traditions,
      more-contemporary artists, who combine African and Western traditions,
      also abound. One of the earliest of these was Ben Ewonwu, who painted in
      oils as well as producing sculptures; to

    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/ethnic-group" target="_blank"

    has its own specialties. Traditional instruments include various types of
    flutes, trumpets, musical bows, xylophones, and wooden clappers, as well as
    many varieties of drums. Music is used to celebrate rulers and to accompany
    public assemblies, weddings and funerals, festivals, and storytelling. At

    rural areas. Dance also has many varieties: Ishan stilt dancers in colourful
    costumes twist themselves in the air; one
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tiv" target="_blank">Tiv</a>
    dance, called ajo, features male dancers who work in pairs, and another
    involves teams of women who perform a dance called icough while composing
    songs about current events. Dance for the Ubakala shows their value system,
    helps resolve conflicts, and also institutes change. Ekiti Yoruba dancers
    wear head masks so heavy that they can do only processional dances. The
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hausa" target="_blank">Hausa</a>,
    who do not consider dancing to be an art, divide their dances into the
    categories of social dancing and ceremonial bòorii dances.

      tennis were spread through mission schools, railroad companies, the armed
      forces, and the colonial
