    <p>Here are the list of top 10 best African Players</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Mohamed Salah</strong>
        <p id="paragraphone">

        <br/>
          Mohamed Salah is a modern-day great and an absolute legend. After
          faltering at Chelsea and AS Roma, Salah found his footing with
          Liverpool and went on to win the Premier League and Champions League.
          Salah is one of the finest players to have ever played for the Reds.
          The Egyptian forward has won multiple Premier League golden boots and
          African Footballer of the Year titles two times. The 32-year-old
          winger is one of the most prolific goal-scorers and has already scored
          241 goals in less than 400 games for Liverpool. Egyptians fondly call
          him the “Fourth Pyramid” for his grace.

      <li><strong>Didier Drogba (Ivory Coast)</strong></li>
      <p id="paragraphtwo">

        alt=""
      />
        The Chelsea legend, Didier Drogba is our best African footballer pick on
        this list and one of the best African Premier League players. He was the
        quintessential world-class forward – quick, fast and strong. The Chelsea
        legend, who became the first player from Africa to score 100 Premier
        League goals, was a nightmare to his opponents. Drogba was a serial
        winner during his lengthy stay at Stamford Bridge as he lifted four
        Premier League titles and the Champions League trophy. The Ivory Coast
        captain amassed 65 goals in just 105 caps for his country.

      <li><strong> George Weah (Liberia)</strong></li>
      <p id="paragraphyfive">

          alt="George Weah"
        />
        George Weah is the most sensational character on the list of the best
        African footballers ever. He was the first African player to win a
        Ballon d’Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award. The legendary
        striker was immensely successful in club football and won several league
        titles with AC Milan and PSG. He remains the only player amongst the
        greatest African players not to feature in the FIFA World Cup. The
        former Liberian captain notched up 211 goals in 444 games in club
        football. His son, Timothy Weah, is also a professional footballer who
        plays for Juventus and the USA men’s national team.
      </p>
      <li><strong>Samuel Eto’o (Cameroon)</strong></li>
      <p id="paragraphfour">
        <img
          src="https://www.sportsdunia.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=828,onerror=redirect/https://cms.sportsdunia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Samuel-Etoo-1024x538.webp"
          alt="Samuel Etoo"
        />
        <br />
        An absolute legend, Samuel Eto’o is considered one of the greatest
        African players in football history. He was the most lethal striker
        during his successful spells with Barcelona and Inter Milan. The serial
        winner from Cameroon lifted the Champions League trophy with both these
        clubs. Eto’o became the African Player of the Year four times and won
        the Olympic gold medal. He scored a whopping 56 goals for Cameroon and
        propelled them to the AFCON title glory on two occasions.
      </p>
      <li><strong>Yaya Toure (Ivory Coast)</strong></li>
      <p id="paragraphthree">
        <img
          src="https://www.sportsdunia.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=828,onerror=redirect/https://cms.sportsdunia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Yaya-Toure-Image-Credit-X-ManCity-1024x538.webp"
          alt="Yaya Toure"
        />
        <br />
        Yaya Toure was the epitome of a perfect midfielder when he was in his
        prime. He was widely known for his long-range shooting, defence-tearing
        passes and leadership qualities. The former Barcelona and Manchester
        City playmaker won every major trophy during his majestic club career.
        From the Champions League to the English Premier League, from La Liga to
        the FA Cup, Toure put his hands on all club titles. He also won the
        AFCON Cup for Ivory Coast in 2015. Before hanging up his boots, he
        recorded 99 goals in his career despite being a midfielder.
      </p>
      <li><strong>Sadio Mane (Senegal)</strong></li>
      <p id="paragraphone">
        <img
          src="https://www.sportsdunia.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=828,onerror=redirect/https://cms.sportsdunia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sadio-Mane-Image-Credit-AlNassrFC_EN-1024x538.webp"
          alt="Sadio Mane"
        />
        <br />
        Sadio Mane is an ever-green player who has taken African football to new
        heights. He is currently playing alongside Cristiano Ronaldo at Al Nassr
        after a successful stint in European football. After coming through the
        ranks of Red Bull Salzburg, Mane came to the English Premier League and
        achieved numerous successes with Liverpool. Premier League, Champions
        League, FA Cup, Carabao Cup – the Senegal forward has won them all. Not
        only at the club level, the former Bayern Munich winger guided Senegal
        to their first-ever African Cup of Nations glory in 2021. He was nearly
        nominated for the Ballon d’Or Award in 2019 and 2021 respectively.
      </p> <br>
      <li><strong>Michael Essien (Ghana)</strong></li>
      <p id="paragraphten">
      <img src="https://www.sportsdunia.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=828,onerror=redirect/https://cms.sportsdunia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aniruddha-P-37-1024x538.webp"
          alt="Micheal Essien"/>
          The aura of Michael Essien can be explained by his £24.8 million
        transfer payment in 2005. Chelsea brought the talented midfielder to the
        shores of English football from Lyon when he was at his peak. The prized
        jewel of the Black Stars went on to win a Premier League title and a
        Champions League trophy with the Blues. Later, Essien played for two
        more European giants – Real Madrid and AC Milan. Essien achieved
        everything at the club level but he was unlucky with the Ghanaian
        national team. He came close to achieving his dream in 2010 AFCON but
        Egypt crushed his dream. Essien won 59 International caps with his
        country and netted 9 goals as well.

      <li><strong> Abedi Pele (Ghana)</strong></li>
      <p id="paragrapheig">
        <img
          src="https://www.sportsdunia.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=828,onerror=redirect/https://cms.sportsdunia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Abedi-Pele-Image-Credit-GoogleWikipedia-1024x538.webp"
          alt="Abedi Pele"
        />
        <br />
        Abedi Pele is an unsung hero in the history of African football. His
        real name is Abedi Ayew, but his achievements as an attacking midfielder
        on the pitch earned him the nickname “Pele” which has faded his real
        name. The former Ghana captain won the UEFA Champions League trophy in
        1993 with Marseille. The 1982 African Nations Cup winner was named the
        best African footballer for three consecutive years in 1991, 1992, and
        1993. He scored a staggering 159 goals in 479 games for different clubs.
      </p>
      <li><strong> Riyad Mahrez (Alegria)</strong></li>
      <p id="paragraphsev">
        <img
          src="https://www.sportsdunia.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=828,onerror=redirect/https://cms.sportsdunia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Riyad-Mahrez-Image-Credit-X@Mahrez22-1024x538.webp"
          alt="Riyad Mahrez"
        />
        <br />
        One of the shining stars of African football, Riyad Mahrez perfectly
        resonates with the incredible mark the African continent has left in
        football. From being part of Leicester City’s dream journey of winning
        the English Premier League title in the 2015/16 season to lifting the
        UEFA Champions League trophy in 2023 with Manchester City, the Algerian
        has collected almost every title in club football. However, his biggest
        feat will definitely be the victory of the AFCON title with Algeria,
        where he was also one of the top scorers in the tournament. After
        establishing his name as one of the best African footballers, Mahrez is
        currently plying his trade with Al Ahli in Saudi Arabia. He has already
        netted 127 club goals and 32 International goals.
      </p>
      <li><strong>Rabah Madjer (Alegria)</strong></li>
      <p id="paragraphthree">
        <img
          src="https://www.sportsdunia.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=828,onerror=redirect/https://cms.sportsdunia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rabah-Madjer-1024x538.webp"
          alt="Rabah Madjer"
        />
        <br />
        Rabah Madjer is an inspiration to the millions of African footballers
        who wish to be at the highest level of the game. Hailing from Algeria,
        Madjer became the first outfield player of the continent to win the
        European Cup. He touched the top deck of his career when he helped Porto
        to become the champions of Europe by defeating Bayern Munich. Later, he
        led his nation Algeria to the AFCON silverware in 1990. He scored 28
        goals off just 86 games in his international career.
