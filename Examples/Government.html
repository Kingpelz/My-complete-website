        Under the 1999 constitution, executive power is vested in a president
        who serves as both the head of state and the chief executive, is
        directly elected to a four-year term, and nominates the vice president
        and members of the cabinet. The constitution provides for a bicameral

          >National-Assembly-historical-French-parliament</a
        >, which consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Each
        state elects 10 members to the House of Representatives for four-year
        terms; members of the Senate—three from each state and one from the
        Federal Capital Territory—also are elected to four-year terms.
        <h1>Local government</h1>
        <p>
          There are two

            >tiers</a
          >
          of government—state and local—below the federal level. The functions
          of the government at the local level were usurped by the state
          government until 1988, when the federal government decided to fund
          local government organizations directly and allowed them for the first
          time to function effectively.

          law (following English law), and

            >sharia</a
          >
          (Islamic law). Customary laws, administered by native, or customary,
          courts, are usually presided over by traditional rulers, who generally
          hear cases about family problems such as divorce. Kadis (judges) apply
          Sharīʿah based on the Maliki Islamic code. Since 1999, several states
          have instituted Sharīʿah law. Although the states claim that the law
          applies only to Muslims, the minority non-Muslim population argues
          that it is affected by the law as well. Christian women, for example,
          must ride on female-only buses, and some states have banned females
          from participating in sports.

        Nigerian statute law includes much of the British colonial legislation,
        most of which has been revised. State legislatures may pass laws on
        matters that are not part of the

        >, and mining—all of which are the province of the federal government.
        Federal law prevails whenever federal legislation conflicts with state
        legislation. In addition to Nigerian statutes, English law is used in
        the magistrates’ and all higher courts. Each state has a High Court,
        which is presided over by a chief judge. The Supreme Court, headed by
        the chief

          independent in 1960. However, their regional rather than national
          focus—the AG represented the west, the NPC the north, and the National
          Council for Nigeria and the Cameroons the east—ultimately contributed
          to the outbreak of civil war by the mid-1960s and more than 20 years

        Women have participated in the government since the colonial period,
        especially in the south. Their political strength is rooted in the
        precolonial traditions among particular ethnic groups, such as the
        <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Igbo" target="_blank">Igbo</a
        >, which gave women the power to correct excessive male behaviour (known
        as “sitting on a man”). Igbo women, showing their strength, rioted in
        1929 when they believed colonial officials were going to levy taxes on
        women.

        power, particularly at the familial and local level, this has not always
        been reflected at the federal level: in the early 21st century, women
        made up about 5 percent of the House of Representatives and the Senate.

          part to the low level of education and the low morale of police
          recruits, who are poorly housed and very poorly paid, and to the lack
          of modern equipment. Corruption is widespread.

        Health conditions are particularly poor in the shantytown suburbs of
        Greater Lagos and other large cities, where domestic water supplies are
        obtained from wells that are often polluted by seepage from pit
        latrines. Rural

        also suffer from inadequate or impure water supplies. Some villagers
        have to walk as far as 6 miles (10 km) to the nearest water
        point—usually a stream. Because people wash clothes, bathe, and fish
        (sometimes using fish poison) in the same streams, the water drawn by
        people in villages farther downstream is often polluted. During the
        rainy season, wayside pits containing rainwater, often dug close to
        residential areas, are the main source of domestic water supplies.
        Cattle are often watered in the shallower pools, and this contributes to
        the high incidence of intestinal diseases and

        Medical and health services are the responsibility of all levels of
        government. There are hospitals in the large cities and towns. Most of
        the state capitals have specialized hospitals, and many are home to a

          Overcrowding in the cities has caused slums to spread and shantytown
          suburbs to emerge in most of the larger urban centres. Most houses are
          built by individuals, and, because banks do not normally lend money
          for home construction, most of these individuals must rely on their
          savings. A federal housing program provides funds for the construction
          of low-cost housing for low- and middle-income workers in the state
          capitals, local government headquarters, and other large towns.
        </p>
        <h2></h2>
        House types vary by geographic location. In the coastal areas the walls
        and roofs are made from the raffia palm, which abounds in the region.
        Rectangular mud houses with mat roofs are found in the forest belt,
        although the houses of the more prosperous have corrugated iron roofs.
        In the savanna areas of the central region and in parts of the north,
        houses are round mud buildings roofed with sloping grass thatch, but
        flat mud roofs appear in the drier areas of the extreme north. Some mud
        houses are also covered with a layer of cement. Larger houses are
        designed around an open courtyard and traditionally contained barrels or
        cisterns in which rainwater could be collected.

        During the colonial period, British officials lived in segregated
        housing known as Government Reserve Areas (GRA). After independence GRA

          did little to promote education during the colonial period. Until 1950
          most schools were operated by Christian missionary bodies, which
          introduced Western-style education into Nigeria beginning in the
          mid-19th century. The British colonial government funded a few
          schools, although its policy was to give grants to mission schools
          rather than to expand its own system. In the northern, predominantly
          Muslim area, Western-style education was prohibited because the
          religious leaders did not want Christian missionaries interfering with
          <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Islam" target="_blank"

        responsibility for education, other organizations, such as local
        governments and religious groups, may establish and administer primary

        Nigeria has more than 400 universities and colleges widely dispersed
        throughout the country in an attempt to make

        easily accessible. Many of the universities are federally controlled,
        and the language of instruction is English at all the universities and
        colleges. At the time of Nigeria’s independence in 1960, there were only
        two established postsecondary institutions, both of which were located
        in the southwestern part of the country: University College at Ibadan
        (founded in 1948, now the

        ) and Yaba Higher College (founded in 1934, now Yaba College of
        Technology). Four more government-operated universities were established
        in the 1960s: University of Nigeria,

        ) in the north; and University of Lagos (1962) in the south. In the
        1970s and ’80s the government attempted to found a university in every
        state, but, with the ever-increasing number of states, this practice was
        abandoned. Numerous federal and state universities have since been
        established, especially during the 21st century. Attempts by individuals
        and private organizations, including various Christian churches, to
        establish universities did not receive the approval of the federal
        Ministry of Education until the 1990s. Since then, dozens of private
        postsecondary institutions have been established.
