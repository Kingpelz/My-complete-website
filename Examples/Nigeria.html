        target="_blank"
        >topography</a
      >
      of Nigeria consists of plains in the north and south interrupted by
      plateaus and hills in the centre of the country. The Sokoto Plains lie in
      the northwestern corner of the country, while the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Borno" target="_blank">Borno</a>
      Plains in the northeastern corner extend as far as the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Lake-Chad" target="_blank"
        >Lake-Chad</a
      >
      basin. The Lake Chad basin and the coastal areas, including the Niger
      River delta and the western parts of the Sokoto region in the far
      northwest, are underlain by soft, geologically young sedimentary rocks.
      Gently undulating plains, which become waterlogged during the rainy
      season, are found in these areas. The
      <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/characteristic"
        target="_blank"
        >characteristics</a
      >
      landforms of the plateaus are high plains with broad, shallow valleys
      dotted with numerous hills or isolated mountains, called inselbergs; the
      underlying rocks are crystalline, although sandstones appear in river
      areas. The
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Jos-Plateau" target="_blank"
        >Jos-Plateau</a
      >
      rises almost in the centre of the country; it consists of extensive lava
      surfaces dotted with numerous extinct volcanoes. Other eroded surfaces,
      such as the Udi-Nsukka escarpment (see
      <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Udi-Nsukka-Plateau"

      >, rise abruptly above the plains at elevations of at least 1,000 feet
      (300 metres). The most mountainous area is along the southeastern border
      with Cameroon, where the Cameroon Highlands rise to the highest points in
      the country, Chappal Waddi (7,936 feet [2,419 metres]) in the Gotel

    <h1>Drainage</h1>
    <p>
      The major drainage areas in Nigeria are the Niger-Benue basin, the Lake
      Chad basin, and the Gulf of Guinea basin. The
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Niger-River" target="_blank"
        >Niger-River</a
      >, for which the country is named, and the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Benue-River" target="_blank"
        >Benue-River</a
      >, its largest tributary, are the principal rivers. The Niger has many
      rapids and waterfalls, but the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Benue-River" target="_blank"
        >Benue-River</a
      >
      is not interrupted by either and is navigable throughout its length,
      except during the dry season.
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Rivers" target="_blank"
        >Rivers</a
      >
      draining the area north of the Niger-Benue trough include the

      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Lake-Chad" target="_blank"
        >Lake-Chad</a
      >. The coastal areas are drained by short rivers that flow into the Gulf
      of Guinea. River basin development projects have created many large
      man-made lakes, including
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Kainji-Lake" target="_blank"
        >Kainji-Lake</a

    </p>
    <h1>Soils</h1>
    <p>
      Soils in Nigeria, and in Africa generally, are usually of a poorer quality
      than those in other regions of the world. However, over the centuries
      Nigerians have utilized agricultural techniques such as slash and burn,
      intercropping, and the use of shallow planting
      <a
        href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/implements"
        target="_blank"
        >implements</a
      >
      to cope with the shortcomings of the soil. In the precolonial period the
      country normally produced enough agricultural commodities to feed its
      population, and it even maintained a surplus for export. Nigeria’s major
      soil zones conform to geographic location. Loose sandy soils consisting of
      wind-borne deposits and riverine sands are found in the northern regions,
      although, in areas where there is a marked dry season, a dense surface
      layer of laterite develops, making these soils difficult to
      <a
        href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cultivate"

        >cultivate</a
      >e. The soils in the northern states of

        >Kano-state-Nigeria</a

      and
      <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Sokoto-state-Nigeria"

      South of
      <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Kano-historical-kingdom-Nigeria"
        target="_blank"
        >Kano-historical-kingdom-Nigeria</a
      >
      the mixed soils contain locally derived granite and loess (wind-borne
      deposits). The middle two-thirds of the country, the savanna regions,
      contain reddish, laterite soils; they are somewhat less fertile than those
      of the north because they are not subject to as much seasonal drying, nor
      do they receive the greater rainfall that occurs in the more southerly
      regions. The forest soils represent the third zone. There the vegetation
      provides humus and protects it from erosion by heavy rainfall. Although
      these soils can readily be
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/leached" target="_blank"
        >leached</a
      >
      and lose their fertility, they are the most productive agriculturally.
      Hydromorphic and organic soils, confined largely to areas underlain by
      sedimentary rocks along the coast and river floodplains, are the youngest
      soil types.

    <h1>Climate of Nigeria</h1>
    <p>
      Nigeria has a tropical climate with variable rainy and dry seasons,
      depending on location. It is hot and wet most of the year in the southeast
      but dry in the southwest and farther inland. A
      <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/science/tropical-wet-dry-climate"
        target="_blank"
        >savanna climate</a
      >, with marked wet and dry seasons, prevails in the north and west, while
      a steppe climate with little precipitation is found in the far north. In
      general, the length of the rainy season decreases from south to north. In
      the south the rainy season lasts from March to November, whereas in the
      far north it lasts only from mid-May to September. A marked interruption
      in the rains occurs during August in the south, resulting in a short dry
      season often referred to as the “August break.” Precipitation is heavier
      in the south, especially in the southeast, which receives more than 120
      inches (3,000 mm) of rain a year, compared with about 70 inches (1,800 mm)
      in the southwest. Rainfall decreases progressively away from the coast;
      the far north receives no more than 20 inches (500 mm) a year. Temperature
      and humidity remain relatively constant throughout the year in the south,
      while the seasons vary considerably in the north; during the northern dry
      season the daily temperature range becomes great as well. On the coast the
      mean monthly maximum temperatures are steady throughout the year,
      remaining about 90 °F (32 °C) at
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Lagos-Nigeria" target="_blank"
        >Lagos-Nigeria</a
      >
      and about 91 °F (33 °C) at
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Port-Harcourt" target="_blank"
        >Port harcourt</a
      >; the mean monthly minimum temperatures are approximately 72 °F (22 °C)
      for
      <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Lagos-state-Nigeria"
        target="_blank"
        >Lagos-state-Nigeria</a
      >
      and 68 °F (20 °C) for Port Harcourt. In general, mean maximum temperatures
      are higher in the north, while mean minimum temperatures are lower. In the
      northeastern city of
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Maiduguri" target="_blank"
        >Maiduguri</a
      >, for example, the mean monthly maximum temperature may exceed 100 °F (38
      °C) during the hot months of April and May, while in the same season
      frosts may occur at night. The humidity generally is high in the north,
      but it falls during the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/harmattan" target="_blank"
        >harmattan</a
      >
      (the hot, dry northeast trade wind), which blows for more than three
      months in the north but rarely for more than two weeks along the coast.
    </p>
    <h1>Plant and animal life</h1>
    <p>
      The main vegetation patterns run in broad east-west belts, parallel to the
      Equator. Mangrove and freshwater swamps occur along the coast and in the
      <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/science/delta-river-system-component"
        target="_blank"
        >Niger-Delta</a
      >. A short way inland, the swamps give way to dense tropical
      <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/science/equatorial-rain-forest"
        target="_blank"
        >rainforest</a

      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/plant/oil-palm" target="_blank"
        >oil-palm</a
      >
      grows wild and is usually preserved when forest is cleared for
      cultivation. In the more densely populated parts of the southeast, the
      original forest vegetation has been replaced by open palm bush. In the
      southwest large areas of forest have been replaced by cacao and rubber
      plantations. Tropical grassland occupies the area north of the forest belt
      and is studded with baobab, tamarind, and
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/plant/carob" target="_blank"
        >locust beans</a
      >
      trees. The savanna becomes more open in the far north and is characterized
      by scattered stunted trees and short grasses. Semidesert conditions exist
      in the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Lake-Chad" target="_blank"
        >Lake-Chad</a
      >
      region, where various species of acacia and the doum species of palm are
      common. Gallery forests (narrow forest zones along rivers) are also
      characteristic of the open savanna in the north. In densely populated
      areas of the savanna, such as those around the towns of
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Sokoto-Nigeria" target="_blank"
        >Sokoto-Nigeria</a

      and
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Katsina-Nigeria" target="_blank"
        >Katsina-Nigeria</a
      >, the vegetation has been removed by continuous cropping, overgrazing,
      and bush burning. In the far northern areas the nearly total disappearance
      of plant life has facilitated a gradual southward advance of the

      the entire savanna region, and red river hogs, forest elephants, and
      chimpanzees lived in the rainforest belt. Animals found in both forest and
      savanna included leopards, golden cats, monkeys, gorillas, and wild pigs.
