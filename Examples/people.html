    <h2>Ethnic groups</h2>
    <p> <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/51/42151-050-5EECEEC2/musicians-Hausa-court-emir-Zaria-Nigeria-kakaki.jpg?w=300" alt="Hausa musicians performing at the amir of zaria northern Nigeria">

      There are an estimated 250 ethnic groups in Nigeria. Each inhabits a
      territory that it considers to be its own by right of first occupancy and
      inheritance. Individuals who are not members of a dominant group but who
      have lived and worked for several decades in the territory of the group
      are still considered to be aliens. In most rural areas, such aliens may
      not acquire outright title to land, yet considerable numbers of people
      have migrated from one ethnic territory to another in search of farmland.
      There are three major ethnic groups in the country: the

      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Fulani" target="_blank"
        >Fulani</a

      group, whose members conquered

        >Hausa-states</a
      >
      in the early 19th century; the great majority of both are Muslims.
      Town-dwelling Fulani intermarry freely with the Hausa and other groups,
      and they continue to control the administration of the Hausa towns. The
      cattle-herding rural Fulani, who generally do not intermarry, speak the
      Fulani language, Fula, rather than Hausa.
    </p>

    <h2></h2>
    <p>
      Another large and politically dominant group is the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Yoruba" target="_blank"
        >Yoruba</a
      >
      of southwestern Nigeria. They consider the city of
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Ile-Ife" target="_blank"
        >Ile-Ife</a
      >
      their ancestral home and the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/deity" target="_blank"
        >deity</a
      >
      Oduduwa their progenitor. Most Yoruba are farmers but live in urban areas
      away from their rural farmland. Each Yoruba subgroup is ruled by a
      paramount chief, or oba, who is usually supported by a council of chiefs.
      The ooni (oni) of Ile-Ife, who is the spiritual leader of the Yoruba, and
      the alaafin (alafin) of
      <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Oyo-state-Nigeria"
        target="_blank"
        >Oyo-state-Nigeria</a
      >, who is their traditional political leader, are the most powerful
      rulers, and their influence is still acknowledged throughout the Yoruba
      areas.
    </p>
    <h2></h2>
    <p>
      The third major
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/ethnic-group" target="_blank"
        >ethnic-group</a
      >, the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Igbo" target="_blank">Igbo</a>
      of southeastern Nigeria, lives in small decentralized and democratic
      settlements. The largest political unit is the village, which is ruled by
      a council of elders (chosen by merit, not heredity) rather than by a
      chief. A smaller proportion live in large towns and are culturally much
      closer to the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Edo-people" target="_blank"
        >Edo-people</a

      of neighbouring

      state) than to the Igbo east of the lower Niger valley.
    </p>
    <h2></h2>
    <p>
      Less numerous are the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ibibio" target="_blank"
        >Ibibio</a

      >
      . In the middle belt, where the greatest concentration of ethnic groups
      (more than 180) occurs, the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tiv" target="_blank">Tiv</a>
      and the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nupe" target="_blank">Nupe</a>
      are the largest groups. Both are settled cultivators, but, while Nupe
      society is hierarchical, that of the Tiv tends to be decentralized.

    <h1>Languages of Nigeria</h1>
    <p>
      The languages of Nigeria are classified into three broad linguistic
      groups:

      ,

      , such as Awak, Waja, Waka, and Tula, spoken in northern Nigeria. The
      Nilo-Saharan group is represented in Nigeria principally by
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Kanuri-language" target="_blank"
        >Kanuri-language</a
      >
      , although speakers of Bagirmi and
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Zarma" target="_blank">Zarma</a>
      are also present in the

      is a much larger linguistic group and comprises

        >Hausa-language</a
      >
      , Margi, and Bade, among others. Some peoples (such as the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Fulani" target="_blank"
        >Fulani</a
      >
      and the Tiv) are relatively recent immigrants, but, on the basis of modern
      linguistic research, it is thought that the great majority of Nigerian
      languages—specifically the Kwa subgroup—have been spoken in roughly the
      same locations for some 4,000 years.
    </p>

    <h2></h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hausa" target="_blank">Hausa</a>
      was an official language of the northern states from 1951 to 1967. It is
      the most widely spoken language, although English is the official language
      of Nigeria. In addition to English, Hausa,
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Yoruba" target="_blank"
        >Yoruba</a
      >
      , Igbo, Fula, and English Creole are widely spoken. Many of the languages
      exist in written form.
    </p>
    <h1>Religion</h1>
    <p>
      At the beginning of the 20th century, most Nigerians were followers of
      traditional religions, but British colonial policies discouraged this to
      such an extent that by the time of independence in 1960 the great majority
      of the people were classified as Muslims or Christians. At the beginning
      of the 21st century, about half of the population was Muslim, slightly
      less than that was Christian, and only a small number claimed to follow
      traditional religions. However, many of those professing to be Muslims and
      Christians also openly performed certain
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/rites" target="_blank"
        >rites</a
      >
      or rituals of traditional religions that were no longer condemned as they
      had been during the colonial period. While a supreme god (called Olorun
      Olodumare in Yoruba, Chukwu in Igbo, Osalobua in Edo, and Abasi Ibom in
      Ibibio) is central to many of the traditional religions, the deity is
      worshipped through a number of intermediaries or lesser gods.
    </p>

    <h2></h2>
    Religious freedom is guaranteed by the constitution, and Muslims and
    Christians live and work together, although there is continuing conflict
    between the two groups and between them and adherents of traditional
    religions. The greatest concentration of Muslims is in the northern states.
    There three-fourths of the people profess the religion of
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Islam" target="_blank">Islam</a>
    , which also is the dominant faith in a few of the southern states.
    Christians make up more than three-fourths of the population in the eastern
    states.
    <h2></h2>
    The main established Christian groups are Roman Catholics, Methodists,
    Anglicans, and Baptists. A growing number of breakaway Christian churches,
    which embrace
    <a
      href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/indigenous"
      target="_blank"
      >indigenous</a
    >
    cultural traditions, are gaining popularity—a development perceived as a
    threat by the older established churches. The breakaway Christian churches
    often include drumming and dancing in their services, a practice since
    adopted by the established churches in an attempt to avoid losing members.
    Another issue has been how Islam and
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Christianity" target="_blank"
      >Christianity</a
    >
    have chosen to incorporate the traditional practice of polygamy.
    Christianity has officially disallowed it, while Islam has allowed men to
    have up to four wives; however, breakaway Christian churches often have
    placed no limits on the practice.
    <h1>Geographic regions</h1>
    <p>
      Marked differences exist between north and south, not only in physical
      landscape, climate, and vegetation but also in the social organization,
      religion, literacy, and agricultural practices of the people. These
      differences form the basis of the division of Nigeria into three
      geographic regions: the south, or Guinea coastlands; the central region;
      and the north, or Nigerian
      <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Sudan-region-Africa"
        target="_blank"
        >Sudan-region-Africa</a
      >
    </p>

    <h2>South</h2>
    <p>
      The south is the most economically developed part of Nigeria. Its forest
      resources are intensively
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/exploited" target="_blank"
        >exploited</a
      >
      , and its tree crops are harvested on peasant farms and commercial
      plantations. All of the country’s major industrial centres and oil fields,
      as well as its seaports, are concentrated in the region. Important
      cultural centres are also found in the south, such as those of the Yoruba
      in the western part of the region, the Edo in the region’s midwestern
      section, and the Igbo-Ibibio in the east. Parts of the country’s Igbo and
      Ibibio-inhabited areas are the most densely settled areas in
      <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/place/sub-Saharan-Africa"
        target="_blank"
        >sub sub-Saharan-Africa</a
      >
      . The Yoruba-inhabited areas where cacao is grown are also densely settled
      and attract many migrants from the congested Igbo and Ibibio-inhabited
      areas. The eastern Cross River area is virtually uninhabited owing to the
      poor soil and climate.
    </p>
    <h2>Central region</h2>
    <p>
      The central region is the most sparsely settled and least developed part
      of Nigeria, comprising about two-fifths of the country’s land area but
      supporting less than one-fifth of the total population. Small pockets of
      dense population occur in the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/tin" target="_blank">tin</a>
      fields of the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Jos-Plateau" target="_blank"
        >Jos-Plateau</a
      >
      and in the southern Tiv-inhabited area. The remaining, and by far the
      greater, part of this region is virtually uninhabited owing to the poor
      soil and climate. Before 1970, large-scale development in this region,
      often referred to as the middle belt, was restricted to a few
      government-supported projects, such as the Kainji
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/Dam" target="_blank"
        >dam</a
      >
      and the Bacita sugar project (both in the northwestern part of the region)
      and a few industries in the towns of
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Jos" target="_blank">Jos</a>
      and
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Kaduna-Nigeria" target="_blank"
        >Kaduna-Nigeria</a
      >
      (now the capitals of
      <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Plateau-state-Nigeria"
        target="_blank"
        >Plateau-state-Nigeria</a

      and
      <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Kaduna-state-Nigeria"
        target="_blank"
        >Kaduna-state-Nigeria</a
      >
      states, respectively). After the national administrative reorganization of
      1975, this central region gained importance because 7 of the then 19 (now
      36) state capitals, as well as the approximately 2,800-square-mile
      (7,250-square-km)
      <a

      >
      were located there. In addition, during the early 1980s a giant iron and
      steel complex was built at Ajaokuta, near
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Lokoja" target="_blank"
        >Lokoja</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h2>North</h2>
    <p>
      The north, or Nigerian Sudan, underwent significant change in the
      beginning of the 20th century, when a new economic pattern was created by
      the construction of a railroad that connected the region to the country’s
      coastal ports. Before then, the Nigerian Sudan was more outward oriented
      through regular trans-Saharan contacts with
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/North-Africa" target="_blank"
        >North-Africa</a
      >
      , the Mediterranean, and the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Middle-East" target="_blank"
        >Middle-East</a

      of the Fulani and Hausa. The former are traditionally nomadic cattle
      herders, the latter settled cultivators; both groups are predominantly
      Muslim. Two regions of dense population are found in the extreme north:

      have impoverished soils and do not produce enough food for the local
      population.
    </p>
    <h1>Settlement patterns</h1>
    <h2>Rural settlement</h2>
    <p>
      About half of the people live in rural areas. Densely populated
      settlements occur along the coast, in the Yoruba-inhabited area in the
      southwest, and in the Hausa- and Kanuri-inhabited areas of the far north.
      In parts of the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Igbo" target="_blank">Igbo</a>
      and the Anang-Ibibio-inhabited areas in the southeast and the
      Tiv-inhabited areas in the central region, settlements consist of

      In the eastern states, each village has a chief, or headman, who, as one
      of the oldest and most prosperous men in the

      , rules by the consent of the people. In the Yoruba- and Edo-inhabited
      areas and in most parts of the northern states, the chief is chosen by, or
      with the consent of, the region’s traditional ruler. A characteristic
      feature of village life is the age-grade system, in which people are
      grouped together with others of a similar age. This system was more
      important traditionally—serving to separate males into three-year
      groupings for purposes of labour and initiation—but its use has
      diminished.
